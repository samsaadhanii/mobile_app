# Samsaadhanii tools
A simple tool for transliteration allows you to transliterate Sanskrit texts among
various schemes.

The Department of Sanskrit Studies, University of Hyderabad, is engaged in developing 
various computational tools for the analysis of Sanskrit text following the Indian 
Grammatical Tradition. This [presentation](https://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/scl_help.pdf) provides a brief introduction to
the available tools.

## Features
 - While **sandhi** shows joining of two Sanskrit words following the Paninian sutras, a sandhi splitter shows all possible splittings of a given Sanskrit string of characters.
 - **Morphological Generator** shows the inflectional, and (some) derivational forms of a given noun or a verb. 
 - **Ashtadhyayi_simulator** shows the derivation of nominal forms of a noun by simulating the process Panini has employed in his Ashtadhyayi.
 - **Morphological Analyzer** gives all possible analyses of a word.
 - **Sanskrit-Hindi Accessor** provides a tool to assist a reader in understanding a Sanskrit text with the help of Hindi glosses, following the steps of Sabda-viSleshaNam and aakaamkshaa.
 - [गवेषिका (The first Search Engine for Sanskrit)](http://scl.samsaadhanii.in:8080/searchengine) allows you to search a Sanskrit word in various Corpora. It also allows you to search on a pratipadikam / dhaatu.
